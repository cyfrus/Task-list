# Task-list
I had to do this basic project as part of job application for PHP developer position in software company in Croatia. Goal of project was to create basic task list with multilingual support where user can add task, mark them as finished or delete them. Task list needs to show last time you opened the task, date of finishing and status(finished or not).
